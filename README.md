A Community Forum and (CMS) Website built with Flutter

The goal is to make a forum website which is customizable based on the user's taste and is responsive and adaptive to any screen size, most probably to any devices as well, since flutter specializes in cross-platform development with a single-code base only.

If making any changes, don't directly apply it to the main source code, make a something like a new branch? Anyways, the point is, we should leave traces everytime we make changes, so that when something bad happens, we can go back to our last checkpoint.
